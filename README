Folder Hierarchy organization:

*
|
|--  hdl:
|    |   HDL (Verilog/VHDL) cores related to the BPM.
|    |  
|    |-- ip_cores:
|    |    |   Third party reusable modules, primarily Open hardware 
|    |    |     modules (http://www.ohwr.org).
|    |    |-- etherbone-core:
|    |    |       Connects two Wishbone Busses, either a true hardware bus
|    |    |        or emulated software bus, throught Ethernet.
|    |    |-- general-cores: 
|    |            General reusable modules.
|    |-- modules:
|    |   |   Modules specific to BPM hardware.
|    |   |-- custom_common:
|    |   |      Common (reusable) modules to BPM hardware and possibly 
|    |   |       to other designs.
|    |   |-- custom_wishbone:
|    |           Wishbone modules to BPM hardware.
|    |-- platform:
|    |       Platform-specific code, such as xilinx chipscope wrappers.
|    |-- sim:
|    |       Generic simulation files, reusable Bus Functional Modules (BFM),
|    |         constants definitions.
|    |-- syn:
|    |       Synthesis specific files (user constraints files and top design 
|    |         specification)
|    |-- testbench:
|    |       Testbenches for modules and top level designs. May use modules
|    |         defined elsewhere (specific within the 'sim" directory)
|    |-- top:
|            Top design modules.      
|-- sw:
        Software related to the BPM.

Simulation instructions:

  -> Go to a testbench directory. It must have a top manifest file:
    cd /hdl/testbench/path_to_testbench
  
  -> Run the following commands. You must have hdlmake2 command available
      in your PATH environment variable.
      
      hdlmake2 --make-isim
      make fuse TOP_MODULE=<top_level_testbench_module_without_the_extension>
      ./isim_proj -view wave.wcfg -tclbatch isim_cmd -gui

Synthesis instructions:

  -> Go to a syn directory. It must have a top manifest file:
    cd /hdl/top/path_to_top_design
  
  -> Run the following commands. You must have hdlmake2 command available
      in your PATH environment variable.
      
      hdlmake2 --make-ise --ise-proj
      make

Know Issues:

wb_fmc150/sim/: This folder containts behavioral simulation models
for memories (ROMs). However, the xilinx initialization file (.mif)
paths are absolute to a specific machine! You either have to change
the path to match your machine or figure a way to specifies a relative
path (specifiying only the name of the mif file does not work as the 
simulator is not called within this folder).
